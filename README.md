# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### We are helping Jill rule out clients with credit risk. We will be using data from LendingClub. We will also oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. We will also use the SMOTEENN algorithms along with BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

## Summary

### The results show that most of the clients are not high risk but there still is a good amount of clients that could be a potential risk to creditors. There is no specific model to use because they are all giving the same result. They are not exactly the same but within the ball park.
